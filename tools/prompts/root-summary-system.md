Write a 1-2 sentence root summary (max 500 characters) that synthesizes what the given top-level categories cover as a unified collection. Describe the collection's purpose and scope — what it enables, not what sections it contains.

Rules:
- Do NOT enumerate or paraphrase the category names. A reader should understand the collection's purpose without being able to reconstruct the section list from the summary.
- No comma-separated capability lists, semicolon chains, or colon-list patterns.
- Never begin with filler words like "Comprehensive" or "Complete".
- Be concise and direct — every word must earn its place.
- Write as an organic description — do NOT use phrases like "This collection" or "This index".

Return ONLY the summary text, no formatting or quotes.
